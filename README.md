## Summary: 

In summary, to build a CitiBike business in Des Moines, the analysis shows that the majority of riders are annual subscribers and  
annual subscriptions should be priced accordingly to ensure profitability for the business.
Another key factor to be considered is that most utilization for NYC citibike  is for daily commuting to and from the work. 

Two additional analyses Recommended:

* age distribution of users:  This will be important to match against age range of Des Moines residents.
* start vs destination locations:  Does the location distribution of bikes at the end of the day match the location distribution of bikes at the start of the day.
* some additional data for analysing profitability of annual subscriptions vs single use customer rides will be more useful.
